DESCRIPTION One 1490Ã—1490 non-symmetric binary matrix stored as an edgelist.

BACKGROUND The data were compiled by Lada Adamic and Natalie Glance. Links between blogs were automatically extracted from a crawl of the front page of the blog. In addition the authors drew on various sources (blog directories, and incoming and outgoing links and posts around the time of the 2004 presidential election) and classified the first 758 blogs as left-leaning and the remaining 732 as right-leaning.
