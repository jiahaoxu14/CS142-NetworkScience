Included are:
	confidence.ppi, a network of physical protein-protein interactions in yeast downloaded from BioGRID October 25, 2013. This is provided as an tab-delimited edge list, with the two interacting proteins as the first two entries and a weight as the third.  Edge weights were computed as described in Cao, Mengfei, et al. "New directions for diffusion-based network prediction of protein function: incorporating pathways with confidence." Bioinformatics 30.12 (2014): i219-i227.
	
	MIPSFirstLevel.anno3, which provided first level MIPS annotation(s) for proteins from the above network.
